Our sensors are measuring a lot of air quality parameters, including CO2. New measurements are typically taken every 30 seconds, but let's imagine every 10 seconds for this challenge.

We want to visualise the history of those CO2 measurements to a user of our solution. The user should be able to see how the CO2 level changes over time and whether or not the CO2 concentration is in a "good" (i.e. healthy/productive) range, or whether it is too high.

Your task: Implement a simple web-based CO2 visualization where a random CO2 measurement value (between 400 and 3500 ppm) is getting pushed every 10 seconds from the app backend to the frontend. Use the following CO2 thresholds for the visualisation:
- Green: <= 1000 ppm
- Yellow: > 1000 ppm && <= 2000 ppm
- Red: > 2000 ppm
Part of your task is to think about what kind of visualisation a user would expect (what would be most helpful for them) and to implement it as such.

Please deploy the working solution on a test server and send us the link to access and review it and the source code for our developers to review.

Frameworks
- Frontend: React + Redux (by preference)
- Backend: NodeJS

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
